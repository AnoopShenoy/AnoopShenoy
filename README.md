### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**AnoopShenoy/AnoopShenoy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improvising my profile by pushing sample projects that I work on to revise or learn any new frameworks or tools.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently brushing up my CSS and Javascript basics so to ease through the frameworks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to Javascript.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help on how to get started with Opensource contributions.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about CSS, Javascript and how to be a chef for your family on weekends.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter - @bt_anoop
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns that I can relate to at my present situation: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a front-end guy with 10+yrs of experience, who didn't push a single line of personal work to GitHub, until now.
